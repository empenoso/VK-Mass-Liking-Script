# VK Mass Liking Script

This repository contains a JavaScript script for automatically liking the latest posts of your VK friends.  It's designed to simulate social engagement without requiring manual interaction.

## Description

This script leverages the `vk-io` library to interact with the VK API. It retrieves the latest posts from your friends' walls, checks if you've already liked them, and automatically adds a like if not.  This script is for personal use only.  Use at your own risk; excessive or inappropriate use could lead to account restrictions or bans.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided "as is" and without any warranty. Use it at your own risk. VK's API terms of service may change, potentially rendering this script inoperable or subject to penalties.
Important Considerations

* Friend Selection: Thoroughly review your friend list before running the script. Remove any friends whose content you might find objectionable, including those posting potentially harmful or illegal content.

* Rate Limiting: The script includes a delay to avoid exceeding VK's API rate limits. Adjust the delay as needed to avoid account restrictions.

* Error Handling: The script includes error handling for friend's posts and other potential issues. Inspect the console output for any errors.

* Account Safety: Avoid using this script on accounts you don't want to risk. Always test on a separate, secondary account if possible.
