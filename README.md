# VK Mass Liking Script

This repository contains a JavaScript script for automatically liking the latest posts of your VK friends.  It's designed to simulate social engagement without requiring manual interaction.

## Description

This script leverages the `vk-io` library to interact with the VK API. It retrieves the latest posts from your friends' walls, checks if you've already liked them, and automatically adds a like if not.  This script is for personal use only.  Use at your own risk; excessive or inappropriate use could lead to account restrictions or bans.
